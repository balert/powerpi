powerpi
=======

Allows to control a PowerPi installation. See powerpi project for more information: http://raspberrypiguide.de/howtos/powerpi-raspberry-pi-haussteuerung/

In the current version, the App allows to set the hostname and port, as well as the objects you want to control. However, you have to restart the App to make changes to settings effective (for now).
